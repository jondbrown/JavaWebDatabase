# JavaDatabase
Finding a free Java server to run constantly for a demo is a pain. So, I have abandoned this for the <a href="https://github.com/jondbrown/MusicDatabase">PHP Version</a>.

This Web app allows for the editing of a MySql Database on a Tomcat(8.5) server using JSP, JSTL, and servlets.

##Implementation
You can still run this by placing it in the Tomcat webapps folder and configure the ports and logins for MySQL in the JSPs and Servlets. That requires recompiling the servlets. So, have fun with that.
